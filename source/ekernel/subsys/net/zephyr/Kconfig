	select SYS_LOG
	default n
	help
	Enable logs and checks for the generic network buffers.

config SYS_LOG_NET_BUF_LEVEL

	default 1
	range 0 4
	help
	  Sets log level for network buffers.
	  Levels are:

	default 1
	range 0 60
	help
	Interval in seconds of Network buffer allocation warnings which are
	generated when a buffer cannot immediately be allocated with K_FOREVER
